## What is OpoLotto?
OpoLotto is a decentralized lottery available to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their citizenship. It's fully autonomous and based on blockchain technology using cryptocurrency.

It does not work like your traditional lottery where you are required to pick numbers; instead your simply enter the draw and your odds are based on your entry amount. When the round is drawn, a winner is randomly picked.

Think of it like a raffle, the more tickets you buy the more chances you have of winning.
